        "Use lists when you need to update or modify data (like student marks or shopping lists).\n",

        "Use tuples when the data should stay the same (like coordinates or days of the week)\n",
        "\n",
        "#4)Describe how dictionaries store data?\n",
        "-->In Python, a dictionary is a data structure that stores data in the form of key–value pairs.\n",
        "Each piece of data has two parts — a key (which acts like a name or label) and a value (the actual data you want to store).\n",
        "\n",
        "~ How it stores data:\n",
        "\n",
        "Dictionaries use an internal structure called a hash table.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each key is passed through a hash function, which converts it into a unique number (called a hash value).\n",
        "\n",
        "This hash value decides where the value is stored in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you search for a key, Python uses its hash to instantly find the corresponding value — this makes dictionaries very fast for lookups.\n",
        "\n",
        "💡 Example:\n",
        "student = {\"name\": \"Sneha\", \"age\": 20, \"city\": \"Pune\"}\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Here:\n",

        "-->1. Removes Duplicates Automatically\n",
        "\n",
        "A set does not allow duplicate values, while a list can.\n",
        "This is helpful when you need to keep only unique items.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]\n",

        "    print(unique_numbers)   # Output: {1, 2, 3}\n",
        "\n",
        "-->2. Faster Membership Checking\n",
        "\n",
        "Checking whether an item exists (using in) is much faster in a set than in a list,\n",
        "because sets use a hash table internally.\n",

        "\n",
        "Sets make it easy to do union, intersection, and difference operations —\n",
